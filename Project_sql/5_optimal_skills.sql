HERE ARE MY QUERY INSIGHTS


1. Most In-Demand Skills

Python (114k postings) â€“ by far the most requested.

SQL (79k) â€“ very high demand, a staple skill.

R (59k) â€“ still strong in demand, especially in statistics-heavy roles.

Tableau (29k) â€“ top visualization tool.

AWS (26k) â€“ leading cloud skill in demand.

ðŸ”‘ Observation: Employers still prioritize foundational skills (Python, SQL, R, Tableau) over specialized ones.

2. Highest Paying Skills

PyTorch ($125k) â€“ specialized deep learning.

TensorFlow ($120k) â€“ AI/ML heavy demand.

Scala ($115k) â€“ big data & backend systems.

Hadoop ($110k) â€“ big data framework.

Pandas ($110k) â€“ popular Python library.

ðŸ”‘ Observation: Niche AI/Big Data tools are the best-paying, even if demand is lower compared to Python/SQL.

3. Skills with Both High Demand & High Pay (Optimal Learning)

To find optimal skills, we look for balance between demand and salary.

Python â†’ High demand, good salary ($101k).

SQL â†’ Extremely high demand, decent salary ($96k).

AWS / Azure / GCP â†’ Cloud skills, solid demand, salaries $105kâ€“113k.

Spark â†’ High salary ($113k), good demand (24k).

Git â†’ Moderately demanded, but surprisingly well-paid ($112k).

Scikit-learn & Pandas â†’ In-demand libraries with >$100k salaries.

4. Lower Salary but Still Important

Excel ($86k) â€“ still widely requested but pays less.

Power BI ($92k) â€“ growing visualization tool, lower salary vs Tableau.

SAS ($93k) â€“ legacy tool, steady but declining compared to Python/R.

5. Key Insights

AI/ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) â†’ highest salaries, niche demand.

Big Data/Cloud (Spark, Hadoop, AWS, Azure, GCP, Databricks) â†’ strong combination of pay + demand.

Core Analyst Skills (Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel) â†’ most requested, essential foundation.

Visualization â†’ Tableau > Power BI in pay.

âœ… Recommendation for a Data Analyst / Scientist Path

Start with Python + SQL + Tableau (high demand).

Add Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) and Big Data (Spark, Hadoop, Databricks) for better salary.

Specialize in AI/ML (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn) for highest pay.
